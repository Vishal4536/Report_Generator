# Report_Generator

This project is an Automated Report Generator that reads intern performance data from a CSV file, analyzes it, and generates a professionally formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The report includes a summary of total interns, total hours worked, average performance scores, and a detailed table of each internâ€™s contributions and project details. It also includes a completion certificate note with the internship end date for CODTECH. This script can be used to efficiently automate report generation for internship evaluations or similar use cases.
